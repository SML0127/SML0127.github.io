      details:  
         I developed distributed web crawler and data management system for web data.
         In this project, I developed front-end and back-end. 
         This system crawls and parses web data in a distributed environment, 
         and supports the service to update the extracted information periodically. 
         Front-end was developed as a chrome extension based on React and JSX,
         and Back-end was implemented based on Python, Flask, Selenium, and PostgreSQL.
         Our system also supports distributed environments by utilizing Redis.
